# Inputs simply prints the inputs it received, including body, query params and headers.
# This is a useful workflow for debugging or providing an overview of the inputs
#
# Example usage: fission fn test --name inputs -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
#
# Note: you need to add the json content-type to signal the workflow to parse and output the data
# as JSON, otherwise it will output the values as plain text.
# In the future there will be an option to default the output to JSON.
